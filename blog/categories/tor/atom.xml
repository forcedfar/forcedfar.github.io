    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am one of approximately 7.13 billion people on this planet. Ideally, an adversary would have a one in 7.13 billion chance of connecting Forced Far to my real life identity. However, it is trivial to narrow this down and assume that I am a member of a much smaller subset of the world&rsquo;s population. I am an English-speaking internet user. I know how to use Tor. There are currently approximately three million Tor users. According to some rough estimates and quick back-of-the-envelope math, less than a million Tor users live in English-speaking countries. Even taking every privacy precaution, my blog leaks enough information about me to eliminate over 99.986% of the population. A keen reader will observe that in making those calculations I essentially outed myself as one who lives in an English-speaking country. Leaks upon leaks.</p>

<p>Maintaining my anonymity is already exhausting. Every communication with every account related to Forced Far must take place via Tor. I can&rsquo;t even view my blog without obscuring my IP address because in the early stages I would be the only visitor and therefore likely the originator. When logged in to Twitter, I have to be careful that I don&rsquo;t view tweets or display behaviors that could leak more information. When doing research, I have to do all my searches through Tor. Every website I view and action I take online is potentially stored forever and could be used against me. It&rsquo;s like Benjamin Franklin said: &ldquo;Three men can keep a secret if two of them are dead and none of them received national security letters or used backdoored machines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This might seem overkill, but the goal is to protect my identity against even the most powerful of adversaries. If my anonymity would be compromised in the event that Github and my ISP are both hacked or forced to give up information under legal duress, then I have no anonymity. This is surprisingly stressful. Although I have taken significant precautions, I can&rsquo;t be sure that I haven&rsquo;t accidentally left a trace. One errant website visit could mean that my unobscured IP address is sitting in a database somewhere waiting like a timebomb to destroy my anonymity in its entirety.</p>

<p>It is also rather difficult to promote this project in an anonymous fashion. My typical first line of promotion for a project like this would be talking it over with friends and family. This way I gain eyeballs and received needed feedback. This time, however, nobody knows that I&rsquo;m even working on a project. It is quite lonely. One day I will write something worth posting to Hacker News or Reddit and people may get curious and a handful may find their way back to this post. For now these words go unnoticed. They are the cry into a crowded room that receives no echo&hellip; or a different, <em>better</em> metaphor that doesn&rsquo;t sound so emo.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It turns out that setting up a fully anonymous online identity is more of a hassle than I thought. I expected I would be able to set up a Gmail account through <a href="http://torproject.org">Tor</a>, use that Gmail account to sign up for Twitter and Github, and be self-publishing in no time. Unfortunately, I ran into a few unforeseen problems.</p>

<h2>Reputable email providers require phone numbers</h2>

<p>It turns out that Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and whatever Microsoft calls Hotmail these days all require phone verification to set up an account. After a bit of searching, I found that Russia-based Yandex was probably my best option. I don&rsquo;t love that. Because Yandex&rsquo;s mail service is often associated with scammers and spammers, a yandex.com email address is like a nice big red flag to anyone with whom I communicate. If you have a better suggestion for a trustworthy, free webmail provider that will let me sign up through Tor and won&rsquo;t require an email address, please send a message to my Github username at yandex dot com.</p>

<h2>Twitter has suspended my account</h2>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="/blog/2014/01/05/twitter-account-unceremoniously-enabled/">Twitter account now enabled</a></p>

<p>You can try to follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/forcedfar">Twitter</a>, but I doubt you&rsquo;ll get very far. My account has been suspended. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is due to my creating an account through a Tor node or my yandex email address, but before I had the chance to follow a single soul or tweet a single character, I got a message across the top of my Twitter window:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Your account (@forcedfar) is currently suspended. For more information, please visit <a href="https://twitter.com/account/suspended_help">Suspended Accounts</a>.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That was fast. Although I <em>did</em> get to skip the page that <del>forces</del> strongly suggests you follow five people before moving on. So I got that going for me. Which is nice. I have submitted a support ticket which I hope will result in access to full use of Twitter. The ticket explained in perfect English how I am not a robot and have no intention of ever being one.</p>

<h2>Some things worked just fine</h2>

<p>The main bright spot was that Github allowed me full use of their platform with no prejudice. I had to do a little Googling to make sure I could push to them through Tor, but Github was accepting of me despite my shady email and dubious IP address. I guess it makes sense that bad actors would be more interested in exploiting services like Twitter over services like Github. There&rsquo;s probably not a lot of money in maliciously contributing to open source projects.</p>
