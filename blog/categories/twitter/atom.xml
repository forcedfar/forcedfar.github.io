    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What has two thumbs and can now tweet? <strong>This guy!</strong> <em>Oops!</em> Now you guys totally know how many thumbs I have. sigh. More <a href="/blog/2013/12/31/the-burden-of-anonymity/">leaks</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="/blog/2013/12/28/an-anonymous-internet-identity/">my inaugural post</a>, Twitter judged me not by the content of my character, but by the provider of my free web mail. Or possibly my shady IP address. Either way, measures were taken to preempt my inevitable misbehavior and my stillborn Twitter account was unable to follow or tweet or be followed or anything useful. I opened a support ticket and received no response, but upon checking today I found my Twitter account to be fully functional. I proceeded to follow a few people taking care to give away as little about myself as possible.</p>

<p>This is a positive outcome, for certain. Also, as a bonus, my support ticket remains open. This lends me hope that they may accidentally upgrade my privileges once more and I will be granted use of the coveted one-hundred-and-forty-first character.</p>
